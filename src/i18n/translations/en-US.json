The architectural decisions were driven primarily by cost optimization - one of the key project objectives was to ensure minimal operational expenses without compromising quality or reliability.",

				"Integrated with Stripe as a secure and flexible payment gateway, the system automates critical processes for the client. It generates invoices for every transaction, manages automated paychecks, handles taxes, and keeps a complete purchase history for end users. This allows the business owner to focus entirely on content and product updates without worrying about the financial and administrative side.",
				"To further improve usability, the application automatically detects a user’s location and adjusts the interface language accordingly, supporting English, Polish, and Ukrainian. This feature makes the website accessible to a broader, multilingual audience while maintaining a personalized experience.",
				"The solution was deployed on Netlify, ensuring free hosting and minimal operating costs, while Google Cloud handles backend integrations. Together, this stack guarantees scalability, reliability, and smooth delivery of resources. From day one after launch, the platform received positive client feedback, proving both its technical efficiency and its business value."
